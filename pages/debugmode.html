<h1>Debug mode</h1>

<p>
	<b>Debug mode</b> is an internal developement tool built to track every action made by WSL during the authentication process. The debug mode can be useful when debugging this plugin but note that it is highly technical and not documented. When <b>Debug mode</b> is enabled and set to <code>Log actions in a file</code>, WSL will attempt to generate its log files under <em>/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-social-login</em> .

	<p> 
		It's recommended to keep the Debug Mode <b>Disabled</b> as will store unnecessary data on your web server. Please, don't use <b>Debug mode</b> unless:

	<ul>
		<li>You are studing how WSL works</li>
		<li>You are implementing new things into WSL</li>
		<li>You have an issue and you really really want WSL to work</li>
	</ul>
