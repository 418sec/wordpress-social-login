<h1>WSL Components</h1>

<p> 
	In a similar way to WordPress plugins, WSL uses components.
</p>

<p> 
	By default, only the three WSL core components are enabled. You can selectively enable or disable any of the non-core components by using the form below. Your WSL installation will continue to function. However, the features of the disabled components will no longer be accessible.
