<h1>Buddypress Integration</h1>

<p> 
	<b>WSL</b> can be now fully integrated with your <a href="https://buddypress.org" target="_blank">BuddyPress</a> installation. When enabled, user avatars display should work right out of the box with most WordPress themes and your BuddyPress installation.
</p>

<p> 
	<b>WSL</b> also comes with BuddyPress xProfiles mappings. When this feature is enabled, WSL will try to automatically fill in Buddypress users profiles from their social networks profiles.
</p>

<p> 
	To activate these functionalities, go to <strong>WordPress Social Login &gt; Components</strong> and enable <b>BuddyPress</b>. Understandably, BuddyPress plugin should be installed and activated in your website in order for this component to work.
</p>

<h4>Profile mappings</h4>

<p> 
	When <b>Profile mapping</b> is enabled, WSL will try to automatically fill in Buddypress users profiles from their social networks profiles.

<h4>Fields Map</h4>
<p> 
	Here you can create a new map by placing WSL users profiles fields to the appropriate destination fields. 
	The left column shows the available <b>WSL users profiles fields</b>: These select boxes are called <b>source</b> fields. 
	The right column shows the list of <b>Buddypress profiles fields</b>: Those are the <b>destination</b> fields. 
	If you don't want to map a particular Buddypress field, then leave the source for that field blank.
