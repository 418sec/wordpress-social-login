<h1>Social Networks Setup</h1>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
	<h4>Important:</h4>
	<p>
		Social Networks Setup is the most important step in order for WordPress Social Login to properly work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Except few, most of the social networks supported by WSL will require that you create <b>an external application</b> linking your website to theirs apis.
		
		These external applications ensures that users are logging into the proper [your] website, and it also allows identities providers to send the users back to the correct [your] website after they successfully authenticate with their accounts. 
	</p>

<p>
	Goto <strong>WordPress Social Login</strong> &gt; <strong>Networks</strong> tab to setup the social networks you want to use and follow carefully the described steps.
</p>

<ul style="">
	<li>To allow your users to use a given provider, you should set <b style="color:blue">Enabled</b> to <b style="color:green">YES</b>.</li>
	<li>If a provider requires an <b>Application ID, key and secret</b> then click on <b style="color:blue">Where do I get this info?</b> [to know how to].</li> 
	<li>To enable russian, cyrillic or arabic usernames, you might need <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-special-characters-in-usernames/" target="_blank">WordPress Special Characters in Usernames</a> plugin.</li>
	<li>Some social networks like Twitter and LinkedIn do NOT provide their user's email address and by default a random email will then be generated for them instead. To change this behaviour and to force new registered users to provide their emails before they get in, goto <b><a href="bouncer.html">Bouncer</a></b> and enable <b>Profile Completion</b>.</li>
	<li>WSL will try to link existing wordpress accounts to the social network users profiles by matching their verified emails.</li>
</ul>
