<h1>Development mode</h1>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	<p> 
		In WSL <span class="label label-success">2.2</span>, we have entirely reworked the <b>Development mode</b> and now it display a nice and comprehensive debugging area on the footer of admin interfaces.
	</p>

	<p> 
		The new Development mode was highly inspired by the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/" target="_blank"><b>Query Monitor Plugin</b></a> &mdash; A must have for Wordpress plugins developers.
	</p>
</div>

<p>
	To enable this feature, go to the <b>Tools</b> tab, then the <b>Development Mode</b> section.
</p>

<p>
	When <b>Development Mode</b> is enabled, WSL will display a debugging area on the footer of admin interfaces. <b>Development Mode</b> will also try generate and display a technical reports when something goes wrong. This report can help you figure out the root of the issues you may runs into.
	<br />
	Please, do not enable <b>Development Mode</b>, unless you are a developer or you have basic PHP knowledge. 
	<br />
	For security reasons, <b>Development Mode</b> will auto switch to <b>Disabled</b> each time the plugin is <b>reactivated</b>. 
	<br />
	It's highly recommended to keep the <b>Development Mode</b> <b style="color:#da4f49">Disabled</b> on production as it would be a security risk otherwise.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:950px;" src="assets/img/devmode_1.png" ></div>
<br />

<p>
	The bottom section of the debugging area will show the hooks fired on the current page, along with the hooked actions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b style="color:#1468fa">Blue</b>: External hooks and functions fired by WSL.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#a0a">Purple</b>: WSL hooks fired by external functions.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#4a4">Green</b>: Fired WSL hooks.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#8e8e8e">Gray</b>: Registered but unused WSL hooks.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:950px;" src="assets/img/devmode_2.png" ></div>
<br />

<p>
	If you are in development mode, and you want do display this debugging area somewhere else on your website, you directly call this function : 
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;?php wsl_display_dev_mode_debugging_area(); ?&gt;</pre>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:600px;" src="assets/img/devmode_3.png" ></div>
